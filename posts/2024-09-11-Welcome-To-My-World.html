      <p>I started this site to just get things out there. No matter if it’s how it should be or the “correct way” of handling things such as trauma and hurt. I also wanted to share other things as well. My creativity first and foremost, but I also like the idea to have a home online. Well… I have many homes online for the moment (other blogs and my “main” website, but I’m thinking about moving it all to this site sooner or later), but I like the idea that people can visit my homepage like it’s a virtual living room.</p>

      <p>I’m Trix and I’m a musician, visual artist, designer and writer. I also enjoy gaming (mostly on switch), makeup, spirituality and the occult, psychology, and a bunch of other stuff. I’m multifaceted and can’t find a niche in life. Maybe that’s because of ADHD and maybe not all people need to niche down their life into a meaningless dot in universe…</p>

      <p>I might seem rude in my writing… I don’t want to, but hey, this is my virtual living room… Anyhow, I like harsh writing from other writers sometimes, so I don’t mind being a little rude.</p>

      <p>Now I’m rambling and I think that will be commonplace in this blog.</p><br>

      <p><i>It was some event in town today so I got this fun earrings and necklace. The necklace looks like a witchy portion bottle and the earrings like a gaming console. So cute!</i></p>
